1	Organic Princess Seedless Grapes	Organic Princess Seedless Grapes! These large, luscious, light green berries are a perfect blend of sweet and tart.

2	Fuyu Persimmons	Jeremy Murdock's Fuyu Persimmons are some of the most delicious we've ever had. Grown in Winters, CA, just 70 miles from our San Francisco Food Hub, these Fuyus are harvested ripe and ready to eat. Though not certified organic, Jeremy--a former CCOF inspector--knows how to grow these Persimmons to perfection without the use of any pesticides or fertilizers whatsoever. The squat, tomato-shaped Fuyu variety--unlike the acorn-shaped Hachiya variety--can be eaten firm like an apple for a mildly sweet crunchy treat, or can be left to soften to a gel-like stage for an intensely sweet experience.	3	lb	9.99	3.33	lb	Produce	New & Peak Season	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/PvSgXM9kRjGef0d9c6vy_20161012-FuyuPersimmon3pd_MG_3507%20%281%29.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

36	Organic Hachiya Persimmons	KNOW YOUR PERSIMMON VARIETIES!From Farmer Bryce Loewen: "At almost every Fall farmers' market, I get at least one potential customer that believes that they don't like persimmons because they have eaten an astringent variety--such as the Hachiya--before it was ready. So many lost sales!"The Hachiya persimmon is actually even sweeter than the Fuyu, but only when it's so ripe that it feels like a sack of jelly. If you eat it at any point before then, it has a tannic flavor (like a mouthful of mothballs) that rivals the greenest plantain. It can take a while for Hachiyas to ripen, but the good news is that they look stunning while you wait."Or you can try your hand at Hoshigaki, a difficult, fascinating method of peeling and drying Hachiyas.	1	lb	4.99	4.99	lb	Produce	Fruit	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/xNrKIc7ZQXuaAedPq3O7_persimmon_02.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

For a quick project and a special treat, substitute Wasabi Arugula for basil to make a peppery pesto.Enjoy!	1	count	4.99	1.81	oz	Produce	Greens	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/BXTCTsRpSmirW13DnSBg_Hikari_Wasabi_Arugula_Clamshell.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

257	Organic Horseradish Root	Knoll's horseradish root is generally thinner and a bit gnarlier looking than you might generally see in the supermarket, but it's certainly not lacking in flavor.Horseradish root contains highly volatile oils that are released when root cells break down by grating.  Vinegar can be added immediately to freshly ground or grated horseradish to stabilize the flavor before it gets too hot, or if you want three minutes to add the vinegar, you'll end up with a very hot paste. Fresh horseradish can also be finely shaved and used to top a plate of steak, potatoes or anything else that could benefit from a slight kick.Fresh horseradish should be scrubbed thoroughly before being grated or thrown into a blender, but as a whole root, it can last for many weeks (if not months) in the fridge in a plastic bag.	0.5	lb	3.99	7.98	lb	Produce	Herbs	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/4hAt5CwUTUeTvmZ69kd6_FK1A1656.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

For us, sustainability is a continuing journey.What does it mean to be sustainable? Good question! At Stahlbush, we think it’s important to explain to people what we mean when we use this term to describe our way of farming and producing food. We define sustainable as “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (based on “Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development,” United Nations, 1987). We like this definition because it shows the quest for sustainability is a philosophy. Our philosophy of sustainability guides our farming practices and affects the way we use energy and care for soil, water, people and wildlife.	10	oz	4.79	7.66	lb	Produce	Frozen Fruit & Vegetables	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/SZv6AdhkT7qpmFp4negy_FK1A4859.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

333	Bijou	"Vermont Creamery's Bijou is my go-to goat cheese for snacking. Grab some apples or other fruit and this two pack and you have your 3pm snack for all week." Erin, BuyerAn American line of French-style ripened goat cheeses wouldn’t be complete without a small Bijou-like Crottin. Bijou is French for “jewel” and epitomizes all that is special about goats’ milk and the making and caring for a small cheese.

367	Organic Cage Free Brown Eggs (Large)	Organic Cage Free Large Eggs- Glaum Egg Ranch, Aptos CAMany of our customers have expressed a desire for cage-free eggs. After careful consideration and in collaboration with our producer community, we have chosen to offer organic, cage-free eggs from Glaum Egg Ranch in Aptos, CA—just south of Santa Cruz.  Glaum goes beyond the letter of the law when it comes to their layers.  These birds have outdoor access from both ends of the barn, constant access to organic feed and water, and space within the barn to spread their wings, scratch and dust bathe. The sides of the barns are screened and can be opened to allow in natural sunlight and the fresh sea breeze.A true family business, Glaum has been far ahead of the game for generations (four, to be precise) when it comes to cage-free eggs and sustainable ranching. They are the first egg ranch in California to be Certified Humane by Humane Farm Animal Care, and have produced zero manure waste since 1988. Glaum is also a member of CAAF (Community Alliance with Family Farmers), and certified organic by the USDA National Organic Program, and are well regarded within the egg producing community, even coming at the recommendation of some of our current egg producers.Follow this link to check out a video of Glaum's organic layers in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSyxtcsSaNc&feature=youtu.beClick here to learn more about egg labeling standards	1	dozen	5.49	\N	\N	Dairy	Eggs	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/tFaJ9FjFS2mbP2mtXCX7_20160708-Glaum_DozenEggsMG_4926.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

446	Organic Grass Fed Ghee	Ghee is a premium cooking oil celebrated for its taste, nutritional benefits, and medicinal qualities. Ayurveda, the ancient medical science of India, recognizes ghee as an essential part of a balanced diet, and considers it to be the best fat one can eat. Ghee is the very essence of butter; the end result of a long, slow, careful clarification process that removes all the moisture, milk solids and impurities. The absence of milk solids and water in ghee make it completely shelf stable. Ghee has one of the highest flash points (485ºF) which make this oil the best choice for high temperature cooking.Ghee is comprised of full spectrum short, medium and long chain fatty acids, both unsaturated and saturated. Ghee contains Omega 3 and Omega 9 essential fatty acids along with vitamins A, D, E and K. Ghee made from organic butter of pastured cows is one of the highest natural sources of CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid). 9 phenolic anti-oxidants, as well as numerous other minerals are present in ghee.Ancient Organics Ghee is always made by hand in small batches, using only organic sweet cream butter from Straus Family Creamery. We are committed to making ghee of uncompromising quality. We exclusively source unsalted sweet cream butter from our local Straus Family Creamery.  The Straus cows are pastured and grass-fed year round enjoying the Mediterranean micro climate of Marin and Sonoma county which provides a constant high level of moisture. When you use your ghee, use a clean, dry utensil to obtain your desired serving. Replace the lid as soon as possible. Be careful no to let any moisture get into the jar. (An easy way you can tell if your ghee has gone sour is to smell it. If it does not smell sweet, it has spoiled.) Sunlight will cause ghee to oxidize and lose its nourishing properties. We recommend keeping unopened jars in a cool, dark, temperature stable place. Opened jars can be kept in a cabinet, away from light for up to 3 months, or refrigerated for up to a year thereafter.	8	fl oz	13.99	1.75	fl oz	Dairy	Butter	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/9d3SBv6ZSE6JcU7dxw86_FK1A7505.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

582	Gruyere	While Switzerland is the country most people associate with Gruyere's origin, its history actually encompasses several European countries. About a thousand years ago, the Holy Roman Empire extended its wily grip around all of what we now know as France, Switzerland, and some of Germany, and the forests of this area were called "gruyeres." Charlemagne's men sold wood to the cheesemakers of the area to power their curd cooking kettles, and the cheesemakers paid for the wood with their cheeses. These are the cheeses that we now know, eat and love as Comte and Gruyere. Gruyere is smooth in texture and has rich, beefy flavors that are tempered by hints of apples and pears. Famously used in fondue recipes, this cheese melts fabulously and is amazing in grilled cheese sandwiches, gratins, sauces or just for snacking.	6	oz	8.49	22.64	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/S9BqwRgGR8KFc6txpHRM_FK1A2398.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

598	Organic Truly Raw Milk Cheddar Cheese	Our raw cheddar cheese is North America's first truly raw pasture fed cheddar cheese. Unlike most other raw cheeses, Truly Raw is never heated above 105 degrees (Fahrenheit) during the cheese making procedure.Why Say “Truly Raw”?Many so called raw cheeses are actually heated to temperatures "just under" legal pasteurized temperatures of 161 degrees, denaturing enzymes and killing beneficial bacteria. It is done primarily to offset the poor quality of milk used to make raw cheese in the conventional market and to increase the activity of the cultures that are added. The cheddar cheese is aged a minimum of 60 days.USDA organic standards require that cows be pasture grazed just four months out of the year. OPDC goes far beyond this standard and grazes our cows on green pastures every day. In addition to green pastures, our cows are fed: a specially formulated organic mineral supplement, free choice salt and trace mineral blocks, high test organic alfalfa, and some sweet organic corn to keep them healthy and strong. Ingredients: Organic Whole Raw Milk, Vegetable Rennet, Cultures, Salt	8	oz	8.49	16.98	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/puIfo2YjTluse2qpYf03_FK1A5474.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

662	Manchego	Perhaps Spain’s most famous cheese, Manchego is a D.O. (Denominacion de Origen) protected cheese, meaning the traditional recipe must use 100% Manchega sheep milk.

666	Carmody	Our Carmody was also inspired by a trip to Italy. We had an opportunity to watch\nGorgonzola being made near Milan. Many Gorgonzola makers are secretive and limit\naccess to their cheese making but our contact was able to get us inside for a short\ntour. After watching the cheese make we went into a ripening room they had at the\nfacility to see some of the early stages of Gorgonzola aging. In one of the rooms there\nwere some small wheels of cheese on an out of the way shelf. We were able to try\na wheel and found it to be a very mild but creamy cheese that still had a great deal\nof fresh milk flavor. We never saw the cheese made but began to notice similar table\ncheeses wherever we bought cheese. They were marketed under a variety of names\nbut meant for local consumption. It occurred to us that a cheese of this type might\nappeal to our customers in the US as an alternative to the young Cheddars or Jack\ncheeses that dominated the market. Once we returned from the trip I began working\non the cheese by using our pecorino recipe as a starting point and making changes\nin response to the flavors and texture of the cheese. Eventually we found a combination\nwe liked. Carmody is meant to highlight the buttery flavors or Jersey milk. At that\npoint we gave it a name with local meaning—Carmody is the road that runs adjacent\nto the farm.\nIngredients:\nPasteurized Jersey Cows Milk, Vegetable Rennet, Cultures and Salt\nTexture: Semi-Firm\nAged: Minimum of 6 weeks\nRind: Natural	7	oz	8.59	19.63	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/6lGfmlFfTVG4vzKXCyAP_FK1A2882.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N
667	Fontina Val d'Aosta	This is the real deal Fontina, made from the raw milk of cows grazing in 6,500 foot high Alpine pastures. Today, milk for production comes from the Valdaostana cows that graze on the Alpine pastures (which are dotted with wildflowers and native herbs) at the foot of Mont Blanc. This semi-firm is washed weekly helps develop its signature funk. The uniquely rich and nutty flavor is reminiscent of truffles, with a subtle fruity, grassy aroma and supple texture. Flavors of Fontina are subtle but complex, and while it makes an excellent and versatile cheese for cooking, it is also delicious for straightforward eating. There are savory notes of fruit, grass, earth and cellar, balanced by a gentle sweetness.	5.34	oz	7.29	21.84	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/jsdtjg3xSW6I5hwjMN7G_FK1A0006.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N
668	Ossau Iraty	Ossau-Iraty is probably the least known 'Appelation d'Origine Controlee' (A.O.C) cheese. The Ossau-Iraty unites two regions of France in the Western Pyrénées: Ossau in the valley of the Bearn, and Iraty in the beech forests of the Pays Basque. The Ossau-Iraty is full of a delicious, nutty, robust taste if it is produced during the period from June to September when the herds move up to the high mountain meadows. Covered by a thick orange to grey rind, the pâte is white, supple and ceamy. It becomes more firm as the maturing period is longer. An artisan pate may have small holes and should not stick to the palate.Made by the Onetik dairy cooperative with the raw milk of Manech and Basco-Bearnaise sheep and aged for 90 days, Ossau Iraty is unctuous, nutty, sweet, and slightly gamey. And if you’re so inclined, it melts like a dream.	5.34	oz	8.99	26.94	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/c6ZCHvLKRc1JiVb7hEuQ_FK1A0029.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N
669	Comté	Comté is a French cheese produced in the Jura Massif region of Eastern France. The unpasteurised cow's milk used is mainly from Montbeliarde Cattle or French simmental (or cross breeds of the two). This hard mountain cheese is matured to perfection in the silence and darkness of special caves where the cheese gets its unique taste, texture and color. There are several maturing cellars in the region where Comté is ripened for a minimum of 4 months to 18 or 24 months. Comté was one of the first few cheeses to receive an AOC (Appellation d'origine controlee) status in 1958. It is one of the most popular AOC cheeses in France with around 40,000 tones of annual production.Considered one of the finest cheeses in the world, a wedge of Comte reveals a pale yellow interior and a texture that can vary from silky, flabby to crystalline.There are practically 83 flavours, which can be savored while tasting Comté. But the main aromatic flavours that delicately linger on the palate are a balance of brown-butter and roasted-nut aromas and a sweet finish.Its ability to melt easily means Comté goes well with many recipes right from fondues to Croque Monsieur. The cheese pairs well with Rhone reds, a Palo Cortado or off-dry Amontillado sherry from Spain.	5.34	oz	9.99	29.93	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/uYJB6dAhRWaUQgpWjPiF_FK1A0070.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

Pack it in a picnic basket, add some apples, or even a hard cider, and enjoy!Four days a week we start the 11 week process of making Gouda.  The cheesemaker's work begins the night before when he makes sure that the fresh milk we receive from a local dairy is properly transferred and chilled.  Before the sun rises the next morning, he starts the pasteurization process and adds cheese cultures to the milk.  Within a few hours, curds start to form and the whey is separated from the batch.  Shortly after, the curds are pressed into a large block and cut into 10 pound pieces which are placed in their molds, fitted with a lid and pressed into wheels.  The next day, the wheels are transferred to a brine solution to cure.  Two days later, the cheese is transferred to wooden drying racks, coated with wax, and begins the aging process where it matures to perfection.Ingredients: Pasteurized whole milk, salt, annatto coloring, and enzymes. Contains dairy	8	oz	9.49	18.98	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/RNC40OMQOG6T3H5kjW7Z_20160513-Oakdale_YoungGouda_MG_9612.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

854	Whole Rabbit (Frozen)	Whole frozen local rabbit from Devils Gulch Ranch.Our rabbits are fed a pelleted feed along with grass and hay to ensure complete nutrition. We work with a local feed mill to produce the pelleted feed to our specifications. It is free from corn, hormones, or antibiotics.Our rabbits are selectively bred to be of excellent quality, large-framed and meaty. They are a combination of three breeds: Rex, New Zealand and Californian. Californian and New Zealand breeds are related and currently are the most popular commercial meat breeds due to their fast growth. The Rex breed, while being an excellent meat breed, is particularly known for its fine fur. Our Rex rabbits have a very mellow temperament. This is useful in their mothering and nurturing their young and in handling in general. While they grow somewhat less quickly than the New Zealand and Californian breeds, we use the Rex to add hybrid vigor and positive temperament characteristics. Additionally, some feel that the meat from Rex rabbits is firmer and better flavored than that of the other meat breeds, which could be due to the Rex's slower growth.We produce all of our breeding Does ourselves. Bucks are occasionally purchased from high-quality breeders to increase genetic diversity, and we occasionally supply other producers with breeding stock. The rabbits are produced all year, but due to the high demand from restaurants, they are not always available for retail sale.Superior quality pelts and rabbits feet are available as well.	2.4	lb	32.39	13.5	lb	Meat	Other Meats	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/boTYXUnrTPej24Uig5DL_FK1A2358.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

904	Prosciutto Americano	Prosciutto Americana was our first creation and remains our most popular.\n Humanely raised,  antibiotic free\npork from Heritage Acres\nand Niman\nRanch is dry cured with\nsea salt\nand aged for 9-12\nmonths.  Ingredients: pork, sea salt. The meat has a sweet, clean flavor\nand a floral minerality.    We started La Quercia to create premium quality American prosciutto, then applied what we learned to other cuts of pork. Our appreciation for cured meats grew out of the three and a half years we lived in Parma, Italy, prosciutto's area of origin, where we saw how the careful treatment of fine materials resulted in an accessible, sublime and entirely regional cuisine. Our ambition to create our own prosciutto came from our desire to take the bounty that surrounds us in Iowa to its highest expression. We seek to contribute to the growth of premium artisan-made American foods by offering unique dry cured meats of the finest quality.It has been hard for us to navigate the highly eroded language of meat labelling. Third party standards can develop, evolve, improve, and worsen. To enforce these standards, we clearly communicate them to our suppliers and do occasional grower visits.We decided to establish our own standards and hold our meat suppliers to them:  no pork from confinement facilities or from animals fed non-therapeutic antibiotics. We require that growers provide the pigs space to socially congregate, a place to bed in deep bedding, and access to the out of doors. We use organic spices whenever possible. Our supplier, Oregon Spice Company, has rigorous safety controls to ensure the purity and integrity of their spices. We use pure sea salt from the United States. We have no known allergens in any of our ingredients, including no gluten. Everything we make is dry-cured and raw, and may be eaten cooked or uncooked.	3	oz	8.49	45.28	lb	Meat	Deli Meat	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/l0dH7Pa9SE2VwxdPM7jq_FK1A0404.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

932	'Nduja	With the original 'Nduja as our inspiration, we're making our own all-local Indiana version. Like the traditional Italian salame, we started by grinding and blending pork shoulder, belly and jowl. We spiked the rich, soft mixture with dried Calabrianpeppers then stuffed natural casings that are about 3 or 4 inches wide, like the Italians use. Here's where we made it our own: our 'Nduja saw the inside of our gravity-fed cold smoker for 10 days before dry curing for 8 weeks. That layer of sweet smoke rounds out the delicious bite of hot, floral, and earthy Calabrian peppers for a slice that's a little more firm than the original 'Nduja but layered with even more intense and complex flavors. The soft center of the salame is spreadable on warm bread for a simple first course, but since our 'Nduja is firm enough to slice paper thin, we'll take it to top a pizza, dress a salad or soup, or stir into sauce for cut pasta or lasagna.All Smoking Goose recipes begin on the farm.

If you are vegetarian, it is perfect seasoning for a wide variety of dishes. Just be creative! It is delicious all year round.Not too spicy, but not too mild. It is a perfect combination of spices, heat, sweetness and tang. The complex, addictive flavor is due to our use of more than seven types of chilies and peppers, and many, many spices.

A product that truly has to be tasted to be believed, this is a Good Eggs staff favorite.McFarland Springs Trout is delicious and nutritious. And it's more than unique – it is the world’s first deliberate collaboration to responsibly farm sustainable fish. This product is filleted with the skin on for easy cooking on the grill or on the stove. Arrives fresh, not frozen. For recipe ideas check out our website.About our trout:TwoXSea began testing our fishmeal alternative in 2009 to produce a farmed trout using a nearly pure vegetarian diet of algae, and plant-based products. Originally the feed contained approximately 3% fish oil, which has since been completely eliminated to create a farmed trout that is raised on a 100% vegetarian diet. The results we achieved are stunning and a true culinary delight. The beautifully balanced sweet flavor, superior texture and lighter firm flesh almost perfectly mirror that of a wild trout. The Omega 3 levels are higher than that of wild salmon as well.McFarland Springs is an environmental dream. The water supply comes from the headwaters of a natural spring, extremely cold and free of the pesticides and contaminates found in other water sources. The spring not only provides for the trout, but also generates all of the electricity for the farm though hydroelectric. It is raised locally, lowering carbon footprint and further promoting regional cuisine. The fish is hand harvested and processed, instead of machine processed as is customary.Typically, farmed fish are fed fishmeal which is made up of small fish that are being taken from the ocean at alarming rates. These fish are then ground, dried, and fed to many types of farmed fish in order to increase their growth rates. This practice is an environmental catastrophe and not sustainable. Lastly, the flavor and texture is that of wild trout with a sweet flavor and lighter, firm flesh. The extreme cold created by the natural spring creates slow growth rates, but far better texture.Thanks for your support!-Team TwoXSea 	0.75	lb	13.99	18.65	lb	Fish	What We Love	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/LXZeml1QTIOPS1FvtBZY_mcfarland%20springs%20trout%20fillet%2010-10-12.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N
981	Frozen Wild Petrale Sole Fillets	Sometimes the freshest seafood comes from the freezer.As soon as fish leaves the water it begins losing freshness. Your average fillet is several days old by the time it reaches your plate, and the taste and texture have already suffered. We use freezing to stop time and preserve the freshness of our fish. We seal our fish in vacuum bags that protect the fillets from freezer burn. We freeze our individually vacuum packaged fillets quickly and at a low temperature, which preserves the texture of the fish. Most importantly, we freeze our fish immediately after it’s caught. Our fish doesn’t travel the world, it’s landed twenty miles from where it’s filleted and frozen. Thaw exactly the amount you need right before you need it, and our fish will always taste like it was reeled in yesterday.Our Petrale sole are caught off the coast of Northern California. We rush to make sure that the fish are filleted and frozen immediately, so that our sole tastes like it was caught yesterday. This fish makes great fish and chips, fish stew, fish tacos, and sole meuniere. You can hold these fillets in your freezer for up to one year.Thawing Instructions: It is best to thaw our Frozen Wild Petrale Sole Fillets slowly under refrigeration. Thawing slowly keeps the fillets firm. Nobody likes mushy fish. Thaw just what you plan on eating. Remove fillets from bags and place in a bowl inside your refrigerator. Allow the fillets to thaw for 8 to 12 hours. Cook fillets within 24 hours of thawing.	0.5	lb	10.99	21.98	lb	Fish	What We Love	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/pk7137xARR6v1Q4q9bTR_FK1A9278.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

Angelo is a smokehouse master and has agreed to make small weekly batches for us so that our salmon is always fresh from the smokehouse. This is a hot smoked fillet, so it will not be sliceable but will flake beautifully. As you can tell by looking at that coating of red pepper flakes on top of the fillet, this stuff is spicy. Gobble it up as-is or enjoy on top of a bagel with cream cheese or sprinkled over scrambled eggs.	8	oz	21.99	2.75	oz	Fish	Smoked	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/GeU7AEqcRECzrZhNZNmi_FK1A5384.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

987	McFarland Springs Trout, Two Fillets	Missing CA Salmon season? Two X Sea offers an incredible alternative to Atlantic farmed salmon- 100% vegetarian fed, CA raised, McFarland Springs trout! A product that truly has to be tasted to be believed, this is a Good Eggs staff favorite.McFarland Springs Trout is delicious and nutritious. And it's more than unique – it is the world’s first deliberate collaboration to responsibly farm sustainable fish. This product is filleted with the skin on for easy cooking on the grill or on the stove. Arrives fresh, not frozen. For recipe ideas check out our website.About our trout:TwoXSea began testing our fishmeal alternative in 2009 to produce a farmed trout using a nearly pure vegetarian diet of algae, and plant-based products. Originally the feed contained approximately 3% fish oil, which has since been completely eliminated to create a farmed trout that is raised on a 100% vegetarian diet. The results we achieved are stunning and a true culinary delight. The beautifully balanced sweet flavor, superior texture and lighter firm flesh almost perfectly mirror that of a wild trout. The Omega 3 levels are higher than that of wild salmon as well.McFarland Springs is an environmental dream. The water supply comes from the headwaters of a natural spring, extremely cold and free of the pesticides and contaminates found in other water sources. The spring not only provides for the trout, but also generates all of the electricity for the farm though hydroelectric. It is raised locally, lowering carbon footprint and further promoting regional cuisine. The fish is hand harvested and processed, instead of machine processed as is customary.Typically, farmed fish are fed fishmeal which is made up of small fish that are being taken from the ocean at alarming rates. These fish are then ground, dried, and fed to many types of farmed fish in order to increase their growth rates. This practice is an environmental catastrophe and not sustainable. Lastly, the flavor and texture is that of wild trout with a sweet flavor and lighter, firm flesh. The extreme cold created by the natural spring creates slow growth rates, but far better texture.Thanks for your support!-Team TwoXSea 	1.25	lb	23.79	19.03	lb	Fish	Fish	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/LXZeml1QTIOPS1FvtBZY_mcfarland%20springs%20trout%20fillet%2010-10-12.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N
988	Frozen Wild Bodega Bay King Salmon	Sometimes the freshest seafood comes from\nthe freezer. \n As soon as fish leaves the water it\nbegins losing freshness. Your average fillet is several days old by the time it\nreaches your plate, and the taste and texture have already suffered. We use\nfreezing to stop time and preserve the freshness of our fish. We seal our fish\nin vacuum bags that protect the fillets from freezer burn. We freeze our\nindividually vacuum packaged fillets quickly and at a low temperature, which\npreserves the texture of the fish. Most importantly, we freeze our fish immediately\nafter it’s caught. Our fish doesn’t travel the world, it’s landed twenty miles\nfrom where it’s filleted and frozen. Thaw exactly the amount you need right\nbefore you need it, and our fish will always taste like it was reeled in\nyesterday.\nOur Wild King Salmon are caught off the coast of\nNorthern California by small-scale fishing boats.

1011	Smoked McFarland Springs Trout Fillet	McFarland Springs Trout is delicious and nutritious. And it's more than unique – it is the world’s first deliberate collaboration to responsibly farm sustainable fish. This product is smoked fillets prepackaged with the skin on. Great for use as lox for bagels and cream cheese, on a salad, or just by itself. About our trout:McFarland Springs is an environmental dream. The water supply comes from the headwaters of a natural spring, extremely cold and free of the pesticides and contaminates found in other water sources. The spring not only provides for the trout, but also generates all of the electricity for the farm though hydroelectric. It is raised locally, lowering carbon footprint and further promoting regional cuisine. The fish is hand harvested and processed, instead of machine processed as is customary.Typically, farmed fish are fed fishmeal which is made up of small fish that are being taken from the ocean at alarming rates. These fish are then ground, dried, and fed to many types of farmed fish in order to increase their growth rates. This practice is an environmental catastrophe and not sustainable. With higher levels of healthy Omega-3s than wild salmon, and zero trace of mercury or contaminants, McFarland Springs trout provides exceptional nutrition benefits. Lastly, the flavor and texture is that of wild trout with a sweet flavor and lighter, firm flesh.
