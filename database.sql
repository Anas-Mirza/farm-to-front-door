61	Organic Hachiya Persimmons	KNOW YOUR PERSIMMON VARIETIES!From Farmer Bryce Loewen: "At almost every Fall farmers' market, I get at least one potential customer that believes that they don't like persimmons because they have eaten an astringent variety--such as the Hachiya--before it was ready. So many lost sales!"The Hachiya persimmon is actually even sweeter than the Fuyu, but only when it's so ripe that it feels like a sack of jelly. If you eat it at any point before then, it has a tannic flavor (like a mouthful of mothballs) that rivals the greenest plantain. It can take a while for Hachiyas to ripen, but the good news is that they look stunning while you wait."Or you can try your hand at Hoshigaki, a difficult, fascinating method of peeling and drying Hachiyas.	1	lb	4.99	4.99	lb	Produce	Fruit	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/xNrKIc7ZQXuaAedPq3O7_persimmon_02.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N

After two minutes, add the leaves, coarsely chopped.  Shake the pan around to make sure the shallots don't burn, then remove from heat after 3-4 minutes, before the greens are full cooked.  They'll continue to wilt and become more tender after.  Season to taste, and add some red pepper flakes for an extra kick or some raisins or dried cranberries to bring out the Spigariello's natural sweetness.	1	bunch	2.49	6.23	lb	Produce	Greens	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/J5MxlTmYQt6XJDc19ZoI_GoodEggs027644.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N
201	Organic Pea Shoots (4oz)	Very young green pea shoots with a fresh pea flavor for salads, wraps, quick stir fry, or wilting with hot water. Eat fresh in salads for that fresh pea flavor all year. Great crunch in a fresh spring roll. For an Asian noodle dish, place pea shoots in the colander and drain the hot noodle over them for the perfect wilt. For your stir fry drop the pea shoots in to retain some crunch. All young greens concentrate the nutrition of the mature vegetable.Packed with vitamins A, C and folic acid, Pea Shoots are a delicious, nutritious modern slant on the classic British garden pea. Lyndel Costain, B.Sc.RD, award winning dietitian and author of Super Nutrients Handbook, says, “Pea Shoots are a nutritious leaf with high levels of vitamin C and vitamin A. A 50g bag of these tasty greens offers more than half of the RDA for vitamin C, a quarter of the RDA for vitamin A and significant amounts of folic acid. It is great news that this healthy and simple to prepare vegetable leaf is readily available to consumers.”From http://www.peashoots.com/peashoots-nutrition.htm	4	oz	3.99	1.0	oz	Produce	Greens	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/8re0JSqSYyDfeB9uxwbI_UYqaOC-Tum2HJrBVLxp_fBox5ZfHFN0FyyHSxBjCxDk.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N

For us, sustainability is a continuing journey.What does it mean to be sustainable? Good question! At Stahlbush, we think it’s important to explain to people what we mean when we use this term to describe our way of farming and producing food. We define sustainable as “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (based on “Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development,” United Nations, 1987). We like this definition because it shows the quest for sustainability is a philosophy. Our philosophy of sustainability guides our farming practices and affects the way we use energy and care for soil, water, people and wildlife.	10	oz	4.79	7.66	lb	Produce	Frozen Fruit & Vegetables	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/SZv6AdhkT7qpmFp4negy_FK1A4859.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N

348	Harbison	Harbison is named for Anne Harbison, affectionately known as the grandmother of Greensboro. Along with breathtaking views, traditions and people are part of what makes Vermont's working landscape special; we're proud to honor Ms. Harbison's contribution with this cheese.Harbison is a soft-ripened cheese with a rustic, bloomy rind. Young cheeses are wrapped in strips of spruce cambium, the tree's inner bark layer, harvested from the woodlands of Jasper Hill. The spoonable texture begins to develop in our vaults, though the paste continues to soften on the way to market. Harbison is woodsy and sweet, balanced with lemon, mustard, and vegetal flavors.Harbison is a great excuse to gather a few friends and scoop into a decadent treat. When a bit younger, the bark can be peeled away for sliced portioning. If the bark has fused with a more loosened paste, then the best approach is to leave the bark intact and spoon out portions from the top. Pair with oaked white wine, or barrel-aged sour beer. Fruit mostarda and crusty bread make nice accompaniments.Ingredients: Pasteurized cows milk, rennet, cultures, salt, 	10	oz	16.49	26.38	lb	Dairy	T-Day Essentials	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/PLGcM8X0RqyYfcMy13eQ_20160921-JasperHill_Harbison_MG_1519.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N

503	Organic Bittersweet Chocolate Ice Cream	Bittersweet Chocolate is Three Twins' standard chocolate ice cream, but there's really nothing standard about it. An abundance of organic cocoa makes it darker than most chocolate ice creams, and it also adds an incredibly rich flavor and texture. The milk, cream, sugar and eggs that Three Twins uses to make their clean, simple base form a blank palette on which to build this enticing flavor.

594	Gruyere	While Switzerland is the country most people associate with Gruyere's origin, its history actually encompasses several European countries. About a thousand years ago, the Holy Roman Empire extended its wily grip around all of what we now know as France, Switzerland, and some of Germany, and the forests of this area were called "gruyeres." Charlemagne's men sold wood to the cheesemakers of the area to power their curd cooking kettles, and the cheesemakers paid for the wood with their cheeses. These are the cheeses that we now know, eat and love as Comte and Gruyere. Gruyere is smooth in texture and has rich, beefy flavors that are tempered by hints of apples and pears.

602	Organic Truly Raw Milk Cheddar Cheese	Our raw cheddar cheese is North America's first truly raw pasture fed cheddar cheese. Unlike most other raw cheeses, Truly Raw is never heated above 105 degrees (Fahrenheit) during the cheese making procedure.Why Say “Truly Raw”?Many so called raw cheeses are actually heated to temperatures "just under" legal pasteurized temperatures of 161 degrees, denaturing enzymes and killing beneficial bacteria. It is done primarily to offset the poor quality of milk used to make raw cheese in the conventional market and to increase the activity of the cultures that are added. The cheddar cheese is aged a minimum of 60 days.USDA organic standards require that cows be pasture grazed just four months out of the year. OPDC goes far beyond this standard and grazes our cows on green pastures every day. In addition to green pastures, our cows are fed: a specially formulated organic mineral supplement, free choice salt and trace mineral blocks, high test organic alfalfa, and some sweet organic corn to keep them healthy and strong. Ingredients: Organic Whole Raw Milk, Vegetable Rennet, Cultures, Salt	8	oz	8.49	16.98	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/puIfo2YjTluse2qpYf03_FK1A5474.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N

657	Manchego	Perhaps Spain’s most famous cheese, Manchego is a D.O. (Denominacion de Origen) protected cheese, meaning the traditional recipe must use 100% Manchega sheep milk. The breed has proven sturdy enough over the centuries to traverse the rocky, arid central plateau region of La Mancha – where cows just can’t hang. Made using fresh, pasteurized sheep’s milk, this Manchego develops a rich nuttiness and pleasant gaminess (think toasted almonds and broiled lamb chops) after over a year of aging. The patterned rind is a nod to the grass baskets previously used to form the cheese. Firm enough to grate for any culinary application, highlight its sharp, caramelly flavor anywhere you would use Parmigiano.	6	oz	8.79	23.44	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/fWeHFFYoSKi785exSgWZ_FK1A7436.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N

The uniquely rich and nutty flavor is reminiscent of truffles, with a subtle fruity, grassy aroma and supple texture. Flavors of Fontina are subtle but complex, and while it makes an excellent and versatile cheese for cooking, it is also delicious for straightforward eating. There are savory notes of fruit, grass, earth and cellar, balanced by a gentle sweetness.	5.34	oz	7.29	21.84	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/jsdtjg3xSW6I5hwjMN7G_FK1A0006.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N

662	Carmody	Our Carmody was also inspired by a trip to Italy. We had an opportunity to watch\nGorgonzola being made near Milan. Many Gorgonzola makers are secretive and limit\naccess to their cheese making but our contact was able to get us inside for a short\ntour. After watching the cheese make we went into a ripening room they had at the\nfacility to see some of the early stages of Gorgonzola aging. In one of the rooms there\nwere some small wheels of cheese on an out of the way shelf. We were able to try\na wheel and found it to be a very mild but creamy cheese that still had a great deal\nof fresh milk flavor. We never saw the cheese made but began to notice similar table\ncheeses wherever we bought cheese. They were marketed under a variety of names\nbut meant for local consumption. It occurred to us that a cheese of this type might\nappeal to our customers in the US as an alternative to the young Cheddars or Jack\ncheeses that dominated the market. Once we returned from the trip I began working\non the cheese by using our pecorino recipe as a starting point and making changes\nin response to the flavors and texture of the cheese. Eventually we found a combination\nwe liked. Carmody is meant to highlight the buttery flavors or Jersey milk. At that\npoint we gave it a name with local meaning—Carmody is the road that runs adjacent\nto the farm.\nIngredients:\nPasteurized Jersey Cows Milk, Vegetable Rennet, Cultures and Salt\nTexture: Semi-Firm\nAged: Minimum of 6 weeks\nRind: Natural	7	oz	8.59	19.63	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/6lGfmlFfTVG4vzKXCyAP_FK1A2882.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N
663	Ossau Iraty	Ossau-Iraty is probably the least known 'Appelation d'Origine Controlee' (A.O.C) cheese. The Ossau-Iraty unites two regions of France in the Western Pyrénées: Ossau in the valley of the Bearn, and Iraty in the beech forests of the Pays Basque. The Ossau-Iraty is full of a delicious, nutty, robust taste if it is produced during the period from June to September when the herds move up to the high mountain meadows. Covered by a thick orange to grey rind, the pâte is white, supple and ceamy. It becomes more firm as the maturing period is longer. An artisan pate may have small holes and should not stick to the palate.Made by the Onetik dairy cooperative with the raw milk of Manech and Basco-Bearnaise sheep and aged for 90 days, Ossau Iraty is unctuous, nutty, sweet, and slightly gamey. And if you’re so inclined, it melts like a dream.	5.34	oz	8.99	26.94	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/c6ZCHvLKRc1JiVb7hEuQ_FK1A0029.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N
664	Comté	Comté is a French cheese produced in the Jura Massif region of Eastern France. The unpasteurised cow's milk used is mainly from Montbeliarde Cattle or French simmental (or cross breeds of the two). This hard mountain cheese is matured to perfection in the silence and darkness of special caves where the cheese gets its unique taste, texture and color. There are several maturing cellars in the region where Comté is ripened for a minimum of 4 months to 18 or 24 months. Comté was one of the first few cheeses to receive an AOC (Appellation d'origine controlee) status in 1958. It is one of the most popular AOC cheeses in France with around 40,000 tones of annual production.Considered one of the finest cheeses in the world, a wedge of Comte reveals a pale yellow interior and a texture that can vary from silky, flabby to crystalline.There are practically 83 flavours, which can be savored while tasting Comté. But the main aromatic flavours that delicately linger on the palate are a balance of brown-butter and roasted-nut aromas and a sweet finish.Its ability to melt easily means Comté goes well with many recipes right from fondues to Croque Monsieur. The cheese pairs well with Rhone reds, a Palo Cortado or off-dry Amontillado sherry from Spain.	5.34	oz	9.99	29.93	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/uYJB6dAhRWaUQgpWjPiF_FK1A0070.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N

947	Prosciutto Americano	Prosciutto Americana was our first creation and remains our most popular.\n Humanely raised,  antibiotic free\npork from Heritage Acres\nand Niman\nRanch is dry cured with\nsea salt\nand aged for 9-12\nmonths.  Ingredients: pork, sea salt. The meat has a sweet, clean flavor\nand a floral minerality.    We started La Quercia to create premium quality American prosciutto, then applied what we learned to other cuts of pork. Our appreciation for cured meats grew out of the three and a half years we lived in Parma, Italy, prosciutto's area of origin, where we saw how the careful treatment of fine materials resulted in an accessible, sublime and entirely regional cuisine. Our ambition to create our own prosciutto came from our desire to take the bounty that surrounds us in Iowa to its highest expression. We seek to contribute to the growth of premium artisan-made American foods by offering unique dry cured meats of the finest quality.It has been hard for us to navigate the highly eroded language of meat labelling. Third party standards can develop, evolve, improve, and worsen. To enforce these standards, we clearly communicate them to our suppliers and do occasional grower visits.We decided to establish our own standards and hold our meat suppliers to them:  no pork from confinement facilities or from animals fed non-therapeutic antibiotics. We require that growers provide the pigs space to socially congregate, a place to bed in deep bedding, and access to the out of doors. We use organic spices whenever possible. Our supplier, Oregon Spice Company, has rigorous safety controls to ensure the purity and integrity of their spices. We use pure sea salt from the United States. We have no known allergens in any of our ingredients, including no gluten. Everything we make is dry-cured and raw, and may be eaten cooked or uncooked.	3	oz	8.49	45.28	lb	Meat	Deli Meat	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/l0dH7Pa9SE2VwxdPM7jq_FK1A0404.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N

993	'Nduja	With the original 'Nduja as our inspiration, we're making our own all-local Indiana version. Like the traditional Italian salame, we started by grinding and blending pork shoulder, belly and jowl. We spiked the rich, soft mixture with dried Calabrianpeppers then stuffed natural casings that are about 3 or 4 inches wide, like the Italians use. Here's where we made it our own: our 'Nduja saw the inside of our gravity-fed cold smoker for 10 days before dry curing for 8 weeks. That layer of sweet smoke rounds out the delicious bite of hot, floral, and earthy Calabrian peppers for a slice that's a little more firm than the original 'Nduja but layered with even more intense and complex flavors. The soft center of the salame is spreadable on warm bread for a simple first course, but since our 'Nduja is firm enough to slice paper thin, we'll take it to top a pizza, dress a salad or soup, or stir into sauce for cut pasta or lasagna.All Smoking Goose recipes begin on the farm.

1034	Frozen Wild Petrale Sole Fillets	Sometimes the freshest seafood comes from the freezer.As soon as fish leaves the water it begins losing freshness. Your average fillet is several days old by the time it reaches your plate, and the taste and texture have already suffered. We use freezing to stop time and preserve the freshness of our fish. We seal our fish in vacuum bags that protect the fillets from freezer burn. We freeze our individually vacuum packaged fillets quickly and at a low temperature, which preserves the texture of the fish. Most importantly, we freeze our fish immediately after it’s caught. Our fish doesn’t travel the world, it’s landed twenty miles from where it’s filleted and frozen. Thaw exactly the amount you need right before you need it, and our fish will always taste like it was reeled in yesterday.Our Petrale sole are caught off the coast of Northern California. We rush to make sure that the fish are filleted and frozen immediately, so that our sole tastes like it was caught yesterday. This fish makes great fish and chips, fish stew, fish tacos, and sole meuniere. You can hold these fillets in your freezer for up to one year.Thawing Instructions: It is best to thaw our Frozen Wild Petrale Sole Fillets slowly under refrigeration. Thawing slowly keeps the fillets firm. Nobody likes mushy fish. Thaw just what you plan on eating. Remove fillets from bags and place in a bowl inside your refrigerator. Allow the fillets to thaw for 8 to 12 hours. Cook fillets within 24 hours of thawing.	0.5	lb	10.99	21.98	lb	Fish	What We Love	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/pk7137xARR6v1Q4q9bTR_FK1A9278.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N

1039	McFarland Springs Trout, Two Fillets	Missing CA Salmon season? Two X Sea offers an incredible alternative to Atlantic farmed salmon- 100% vegetarian fed, CA raised, McFarland Springs trout! A product that truly has to be tasted to be believed, this is a Good Eggs staff favorite.McFarland Springs Trout is delicious and nutritious. And it's more than unique – it is the world’s first deliberate collaboration to responsibly farm sustainable fish. This product is filleted with the skin on for easy cooking on the grill or on the stove. Arrives fresh, not frozen. For recipe ideas check out our website.About our trout:TwoXSea began testing our fishmeal alternative in 2009 to produce a farmed trout using a nearly pure vegetarian diet of algae, and plant-based products. Originally the feed contained approximately 3% fish oil, which has since been completely eliminated to create a farmed trout that is raised on a 100% vegetarian diet. The results we achieved are stunning and a true culinary delight. The beautifully balanced sweet flavor, superior texture and lighter firm flesh almost perfectly mirror that of a wild trout. The Omega 3 levels are higher than that of wild salmon as well.McFarland Springs is an environmental dream. The water supply comes from the headwaters of a natural spring, extremely cold and free of the pesticides and contaminates found in other water sources. The spring not only provides for the trout, but also generates all of the electricity for the farm though hydroelectric. It is raised locally, lowering carbon footprint and further promoting regional cuisine. The fish is hand harvested and processed, instead of machine processed as is customary.Typically, farmed fish are fed fishmeal which is made up of small fish that are being taken from the ocean at alarming rates. These fish are then ground, dried, and fed to many types of farmed fish in order to increase their growth rates. This practice is an environmental catastrophe and not sustainable. Lastly, the flavor and texture is that of wild trout with a sweet flavor and lighter, firm flesh. The extreme cold created by the natural spring creates slow growth rates, but far better texture.Thanks for your support!-Team TwoXSea 	1	lb	18.99	18.99	lb	Fish	Fish	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/LXZeml1QTIOPS1FvtBZY_mcfarland%20springs%20trout%20fillet%2010-10-12.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N

1052	Frozen Wild Sablefish Fillet	Sometimes the freshest seafood comes from\nthe freezer. \nAs soon as fish leaves the water it\nbegins losing freshness. Your average fillet is several days old by the time it\nreaches your plate, and the taste and texture have already suffered. We use\nfreezing to stop time and preserve the freshness of our fish. We seal our fish\nin vacuum bags that protect the fillets from freezer burn. We freeze our\nindividually vacuum packaged fillets quickly and at a low temperature, which\npreserves the texture of the fish. Most importantly, we freeze our fish immediately\nafter it’s caught. Our fish doesn’t travel the world, it’s landed twenty miles\nfrom where it’s filleted and frozen. Thaw exactly the amount you need right\nbefore you need it, and our fish will always taste like it was reeled in\nyesterday. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur\nsablefish are caught off the coast of Northern California by small-scale fishing\nboats using traps. We rush to make sure that the fish are filleted and frozen immediately,\nso that our sablefish tastes like it was caught yesterday. These rich, buttery\nfish are commonly called Black cod, though they are not technically a part of the\ncod family. You can hold these fillets in your freezer for up to one year.\nThawing Instructions: It is\nbest to thaw our Frozen Wild Sablefish Fillets slowly under refrigeration. Thawing\nslowly keeps the fillets firm. Nobody likes mushy fish. Thaw just what you\nplan on eating. Remove fillets from bags and place in a bowl inside your\nrefrigerator. Allow the fillets to thaw for 8 to 12 hours. Cook fillets within\n24 hours of thawing.\n   	0.5	lb	14.99	29.98	lb	Fish	Fish	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/kMzA60HwTXW9RryV9C8b_FK1A0461.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N
