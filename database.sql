4	Fuyu Persimmons	Jeremy Murdock's Fuyu Persimmons are some of the most delicious we've ever had.

The squat, tomato-shaped Fuyu variety--unlike the acorn-shaped Hachiya variety--can be eaten firm like an apple for a mildly sweet crunchy treat, or can be left to soften to a gel-like stage for an intensely sweet experience.	3	lb	9.99	Produce	New & Peak Season	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/PvSgXM9kRjGef0d9c6vy_20161012-FuyuPersimmon3pd_MG_3507%20%281%29.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

10	Transitional Organic Jack O' Lantern Pumpkin	We're told not to play with our food, but this is the time of year to ignore the rule and have at it. Carve and decorate your front steps or simply let these pumpkins remain part of the decor throughout Autumn. If you do carve them, however, don't forget to set aside the seeds for roasting!Blue House Farm's Pumpkins were grown on their new plot in San Gregorio, where most of that new acreage is still two years away from organic certification. They were grown with practices that comply with certification, but until the land has complied with organic standards for three years in a row, it can't yet be certified as organic. At Good Eggs, we're excited to support the transition of land from use in conventional agriculture to use in organic agriculture, so we love the idea of paying full organic prices for these Pumpkins and helping to tell the story of the land's transition.	1	count	6.49	Produce	New & Peak Season	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/pQmctGq3RByKdxAsfdJc_pumpkinsale.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N
11	Organic Cinderella Pumpkin	These large, beautiful, lobed Pumpkins have a red-orange skin with a creamy, rich flesh. They sometimes have a dark green webbing to them and the occasional (spooky!) scarring, but that just makes them look all the cooler and shouldn't affect their flavor at all. They're beautiful enough to replace your standard Jack-O-Lantern Pumpkin, and delicious enough to roast into your next pumpkin pie filling.	1	count	14.99	Produce	New & Peak Season	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/cQLSIgzOS6C4ci5dWdtK_20161027-CinderellaPumpkinTrio_MG_5377.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

So many lost sales!"The Hachiya persimmon is actually even sweeter than the Fuyu, but only when it's so ripe that it feels like a sack of jelly. If you eat it at any point before then, it has a tannic flavor (like a mouthful of mothballs) that rivals the greenest plantain. It can take a while for Hachiyas to ripen, but the good news is that they look stunning while you wait."Or you can try your hand at Hoshigaki, a difficult, fascinating method of peeling and drying Hachiyas.	1	lb	4.99	Produce	Fruit	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/xNrKIc7ZQXuaAedPq3O7_persimmon_02.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

446	Organic Grass Fed Ghee	Ghee is a premium cooking oil celebrated for its taste, nutritional benefits, and medicinal qualities. Ayurveda, the ancient medical science of India, recognizes ghee as an essential part of a balanced diet, and considers it to be the best fat one can eat. Ghee is the very essence of butter; the end result of a long, slow, careful clarification process that removes all the moisture, milk solids and impurities. The absence of milk solids and water in ghee make it completely shelf stable. Ghee has one of the highest flash points (485ºF) which make this oil the best choice for high temperature cooking.Ghee is comprised of full spectrum short, medium and long chain fatty acids, both unsaturated and saturated. Ghee contains Omega 3 and Omega 9 essential fatty acids along with vitamins A, D, E and K. Ghee made from organic butter of pastured cows is one of the highest natural sources of CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid). 9 phenolic anti-oxidants, as well as numerous other minerals are present in ghee.Ancient Organics Ghee is always made by hand in small batches, using only organic sweet cream butter from Straus Family Creamery. We are committed to making ghee of uncompromising quality. We exclusively source unsalted sweet cream butter from our local Straus Family Creamery.  The Straus cows are pastured and grass-fed year round enjoying the Mediterranean micro climate of Marin and Sonoma county which provides a constant high level of moisture. When you use your ghee, use a clean, dry utensil to obtain your desired serving. Replace the lid as soon as possible. Be careful no to let any moisture get into the jar. (An easy way you can tell if your ghee has gone sour is to smell it. If it does not smell sweet, it has spoiled.) Sunlight will cause ghee to oxidize and lose its nourishing properties. We recommend keeping unopened jars in a cool, dark, temperature stable place. Opened jars can be kept in a cabinet, away from light for up to 3 months, or refrigerated for up to a year thereafter.	32	fl oz	39.99	Dairy	Butter	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/4U2PPEBXRVu9wFozcShW_FK1A7510.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

456	Lightly Salted Cultured Butter	While working on a dairy farm in Brittany, France, Allison Hooper took careful note of what happened to the milk. After each milking, she set the cream aside.

583	Organic Truly Raw Milk Cheddar Cheese	Our raw cheddar cheese is North America's first truly raw pasture fed cheddar cheese. Unlike most other raw cheeses, Truly Raw is never heated above 105 degrees (Fahrenheit) during the cheese making procedure.Why Say “Truly Raw”?Many so called raw cheeses are actually heated to temperatures "just under" legal pasteurized temperatures of 161 degrees, denaturing enzymes and killing beneficial bacteria. It is done primarily to offset the poor quality of milk used to make raw cheese in the conventional market and to increase the activity of the cultures that are added. The cheddar cheese is aged a minimum of 60 days.USDA organic standards require that cows be pasture grazed just four months out of the year. OPDC goes far beyond this standard and grazes our cows on green pastures every day. In addition to green pastures, our cows are fed: a specially formulated organic mineral supplement, free choice salt and trace mineral blocks, high test organic alfalfa, and some sweet organic corn to keep them healthy and strong. Ingredients: Organic Whole Raw Milk, Vegetable Rennet, Cultures, Salt	8	oz	8.49	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/puIfo2YjTluse2qpYf03_FK1A5474.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

592	Gruyere	While Switzerland is the country most people associate with Gruyere's origin, its history actually encompasses several European countries. About a thousand years ago, the Holy Roman Empire extended its wily grip around all of what we now know as France, Switzerland, and some of Germany, and the forests of this area were called "gruyeres." Charlemagne's men sold wood to the cheesemakers of the area to power their curd cooking kettles, and the cheesemakers paid for the wood with their cheeses. These are the cheeses that we now know, eat and love as Comte and Gruyere. Gruyere is smooth in texture and has rich, beefy flavors that are tempered by hints of apples and pears.

A half-century later, his grandson, Bob, and Bob's new wife, Dean, bought a farm near Tomales Bay and began raising Holstein cows and selling milk to a local creamery. Their herd grew from 150 to 500 by the mid-1990s, and the farm’s lush pastures are now certified organic. Bob and Dean had four daughters and, in 2000, the family launched the Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Company, using its own milk to make its first cheese, Point Reyes Original Blue.	6	oz	8.99	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/0lA8Iu7R8yyOkLBThAVi_FK1A0481.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N
631	Willoughby	Willoughby is an original creation of Marisa Mauro’s Ploughgate Creamery, a Cellars collaborator that ceased production of the cheese after a creamery fire in 2011.

Willoughby has a thin, tender, rosy-orange rind, which adds earthy dimension to the texture and flavors of the gooey interior.Willoughby’s small format is ideal for selling whole on the retail counter, or quickly rotating through a professional kitchen. The pudding-like texture may become softer with age, but should remain sliceable for portioning until 9 weeks after its production date.

632	Harbison	Harbison is named for Anne Harbison, affectionately known as the grandmother of Greensboro. Along with breathtaking views, traditions and people are part of what makes Vermont's working landscape special; we're proud to honor Ms. Harbison's contribution with this cheese.Harbison is a soft-ripened cheese with a rustic, bloomy rind. Young cheeses are wrapped in strips of spruce cambium, the tree's inner bark layer, harvested from the woodlands of Jasper Hill. The spoonable texture begins to develop in our vaults, though the paste continues to soften on the way to market. Harbison is woodsy and sweet, balanced with lemon, mustard, and vegetal flavors.Harbison is a great excuse to gather a few friends and scoop into a decadent treat.

664	Carmody	Our Carmody was also inspired by a trip to Italy. We had an opportunity to watch\nGorgonzola being made near Milan. Many Gorgonzola makers are secretive and limit\naccess to their cheese making but our contact was able to get us inside for a short\ntour. After watching the cheese make we went into a ripening room they had at the\nfacility to see some of the early stages of Gorgonzola aging. In one of the rooms there\nwere some small wheels of cheese on an out of the way shelf. We were able to try\na wheel and found it to be a very mild but creamy cheese that still had a great deal\nof fresh milk flavor. We never saw the cheese made but began to notice similar table\ncheeses wherever we bought cheese. They were marketed under a variety of names\nbut meant for local consumption. It occurred to us that a cheese of this type might\nappeal to our customers in the US as an alternative to the young Cheddars or Jack\ncheeses that dominated the market. Once we returned from the trip I began working\non the cheese by using our pecorino recipe as a starting point and making changes\nin response to the flavors and texture of the cheese. Eventually we found a combination\nwe liked. Carmody is meant to highlight the buttery flavors or Jersey milk. At that\npoint we gave it a name with local meaning—Carmody is the road that runs adjacent\nto the farm.\nIngredients:\nPasteurized Jersey Cows Milk, Vegetable Rennet, Cultures and Salt\nTexture: Semi-Firm\nAged: Minimum of 6 weeks\nRind: Natural	7	oz	8.59	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/6lGfmlFfTVG4vzKXCyAP_FK1A2882.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N
665	Ossau Iraty	Ossau-Iraty is probably the least known 'Appelation d'Origine Controlee' (A.O.C) cheese. The Ossau-Iraty unites two regions of France in the Western Pyrénées: Ossau in the valley of the Bearn, and Iraty in the beech forests of the Pays Basque. The Ossau-Iraty is full of a delicious, nutty, robust taste if it is produced during the period from June to September when the herds move up to the high mountain meadows. Covered by a thick orange to grey rind, the pâte is white, supple and ceamy. It becomes more firm as the maturing period is longer. An artisan pate may have small holes and should not stick to the palate.Made by the Onetik dairy cooperative with the raw milk of Manech and Basco-Bearnaise sheep and aged for 90 days, Ossau Iraty is unctuous, nutty, sweet, and slightly gamey.

666	Young Gouda	Oakdale's Young Gouda is a throwback to a classic dutch gouda. Soft, mild, creamy, and buttery. Perfect for snacking and for melting! Pack it in a picnic basket, add some apples, or even a hard cider, and enjoy!Four days a week we start the 11 week process of making Gouda.  The cheesemaker's work begins the night before when he makes sure that the fresh milk we receive from a local dairy is properly transferred and chilled.  Before the sun rises the next morning, he starts the pasteurization process and adds cheese cultures to the milk.  Within a few hours, curds start to form and the whey is separated from the batch.  Shortly after, the curds are pressed into a large block and cut into 10 pound pieces which are placed in their molds, fitted with a lid and pressed into wheels.  The next day, the wheels are transferred to a brine solution to cure.  Two days later, the cheese is transferred to wooden drying racks, coated with wax, and begins the aging process where it matures to perfection.Ingredients: Pasteurized whole milk, salt, annatto coloring, and enzymes. Contains dairy	8	oz	9.49	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/RNC40OMQOG6T3H5kjW7Z_20160513-Oakdale_YoungGouda_MG_9612.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

676	Comté	Comté is a French cheese produced in the Jura Massif region of Eastern France. The unpasteurised cow's milk used is mainly from Montbeliarde Cattle or French simmental (or cross breeds of the two). This hard mountain cheese is matured to perfection in the silence and darkness of special caves where the cheese gets its unique taste, texture and color. There are several maturing cellars in the region where Comté is ripened for a minimum of 4 months to 18 or 24 months. Comté was one of the first few cheeses to receive an AOC (Appellation d'origine controlee) status in 1958. It is one of the most popular AOC cheeses in France with around 40,000 tones of annual production.Considered one of the finest cheeses in the world, a wedge of Comte reveals a pale yellow interior and a texture that can vary from silky, flabby to crystalline.There are practically 83 flavours, which can be savored while tasting Comté. But the main aromatic flavours that delicately linger on the palate are a balance of brown-butter and roasted-nut aromas and a sweet finish.Its ability to melt easily means Comté goes well with many recipes right from fondues to Croque Monsieur. The cheese pairs well with Rhone reds, a Palo Cortado or off-dry Amontillado sherry from Spain.	5.34	oz	9.99	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/uYJB6dAhRWaUQgpWjPiF_FK1A0070.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

733	Pasture Raised Heritage Chicken (Frozen)	It's time to taste chicken for the first time.When you taste a heritage bird, you're truly tasting chicken for the first time; the way chicken used to taste, and can taste again. Only heritage genetics allow for slow, balanced growth. Letting muscles naturally develop, in-sync with all of facets of the bird's growth, leads to dense meat with rich boldness, and deep chicken flavors.Because our chickens have never been genetically manipulated for fast growth and unnaturally large breasts, they are smaller than conventional chickens with leaner breasts and well developed legs. They also have a thick, flavorful skin that will brown into a savory, crispy crust when you roast your bird. 100% heritage chicken.Emmer & Co. chickens are 100% factory-free from egg to meat - their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents were all healthy, balanced chickens. Raised without hormones or antibiotics, only heritage chickens grow the right way, naturally developing strong muscular, skeletal, and immune systems. Our birds take at least 16 weeks (112 days) to grow, 3-4 times longer than the industry average, and are raised their whole lives outside on unrestricted, lush pastures.Emmer & Co. heritage chickens are processed individually by hand, and our USDA-inspected facility uses the most humane methods possible. The birds are air-chilled, and no chlorine baths or other harmful practices are ever used.To learn more about what makes a bird heritage visit: www.emmerandco.com/heritageHow they're raised.Because heritage birds have the genetics of their wild ancestors, they need to live their entire lives on unrestricted pasture with enough freedom to roam, play, forage and and live the active life their bodies require. They are provided with a vegetarian grain mix to supplement whatever they eat on the pasture, which includes insects, grasses, and seeds. We work with independent family famers in Northern California who uphold the strictest welfare and husbandry standards. And not only do our farming partners care about the animals, they care about the environment. We think holistically about raising animals so we rotate our pastures to ensure that the soil is healthy and the land can thrive.To learn more about our practices visit: http://www.emmerandco.com/ourbirds Health.Heritage chickens naturally have 60% less fat, 50% less cholesterol, 35% less calories, more protein and less sodium than organic chicken - it's all in the genes!Stock.After roasting your heritage chicken, we suggest simmering the carcass and neck with vegetables and herbs overnight to make a delicious, nutrient-packed stock. Heritage chicken creates a powerfully flavorful broth that simply can't be achieved with conventional birds; many of our customers say that making stock is one of their favorite parts of ordering heritage chicken. 	3.5	lb	34.99	Meat	Poultry	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/81dzQfKSR6Km8ka7mOQz_032116_GoodEggs-4579.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

809	Smoked Tasso Ham	By following the Cajun tradition this "ham" is cut from the pork shoulder rather than the hind legs. The rich dense meat is heavily spiced with white pepper, allspice, chilies, and marjoram before hanging in the smokehouse for a thick lick of smoke from the smoldering pecan wood. Traditionally used in cajun cooking adding depth to gumbo, jambalaya and dirty rice but can be used in other styles of cooking too. Add a bit of chopped tasso to creamy dips and fondues for rich, peppery bite and pleasing texture. Or add to eggs, greens, soups, or use it as the perfect accompaniment to briny shellfish.All Smoking Goose recipes begin on the farm.

817	Whole Rabbit (Frozen)	Whole frozen local rabbit from Devils Gulch Ranch.Our rabbits are fed a pelleted feed along with grass and hay to ensure complete nutrition. We work with a local feed mill to produce the pelleted feed to our specifications. It is free from corn, hormones, or antibiotics.Our rabbits are selectively bred to be of excellent quality, large-framed and meaty. They are a combination of three breeds: Rex, New Zealand and Californian. Californian and New Zealand breeds are related and currently are the most popular commercial meat breeds due to their fast growth. The Rex breed, while being an excellent meat breed, is particularly known for its fine fur. Our Rex rabbits have a very mellow temperament. This is useful in their mothering and nurturing their young and in handling in general. While they grow somewhat less quickly than the New Zealand and Californian breeds, we use the Rex to add hybrid vigor and positive temperament characteristics. Additionally, some feel that the meat from Rex rabbits is firmer and better flavored than that of the other meat breeds, which could be due to the Rex's slower growth.We produce all of our breeding Does ourselves. Bucks are occasionally purchased from high-quality breeders to increase genetic diversity, and we occasionally supply other producers with breeding stock. The rabbits are produced all year, but due to the high demand from restaurants, they are not always available for retail sale.Superior quality pelts and rabbits feet are available as well.	2.4	lb	32.39	Meat	Other Meats	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/boTYXUnrTPej24Uig5DL_FK1A2358.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

867	Prosciutto Americano	Prosciutto Americana was our first creation and remains our most popular.\n Humanely raised,  antibiotic free\npork from Heritage Acres\nand Niman\nRanch is dry cured with\nsea salt\nand aged for 9-12\nmonths.  Ingredients: pork, sea salt. The meat has a sweet, clean flavor\nand a floral minerality.    We started La Quercia to create premium quality American prosciutto, then applied what we learned to other cuts of pork. Our appreciation for cured meats grew out of the three and a half years we lived in Parma, Italy, prosciutto's area of origin, where we saw how the careful treatment of fine materials resulted in an accessible, sublime and entirely regional cuisine. Our ambition to create our own prosciutto came from our desire to take the bounty that surrounds us in Iowa to its highest expression. We seek to contribute to the growth of premium artisan-made American foods by offering unique dry cured meats of the finest quality.It has been hard for us to navigate the highly eroded language of meat labelling. Third party standards can develop, evolve, improve, and worsen. To enforce these standards, we clearly communicate them to our suppliers and do occasional grower visits.We decided to establish our own standards and hold our meat suppliers to them:  no pork from confinement facilities or from animals fed non-therapeutic antibiotics. We require that growers provide the pigs space to socially congregate, a place to bed in deep bedding, and access to the out of doors. We use organic spices whenever possible. Our supplier, Oregon Spice Company, has rigorous safety controls to ensure the purity and integrity of their spices. We use pure sea salt from the United States. We have no known allergens in any of our ingredients, including no gluten. Everything we make is dry-cured and raw, and may be eaten cooked or uncooked.	3	oz	8.49	Meat	Deli Meat	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/l0dH7Pa9SE2VwxdPM7jq_FK1A0404.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

899	'Nduja	With the original 'Nduja as our inspiration, we're making our own all-local Indiana version. Like the traditional Italian salame, we started by grinding and blending pork shoulder, belly and jowl. We spiked the rich, soft mixture with dried Calabrianpeppers then stuffed natural casings that are about 3 or 4 inches wide, like the Italians use. Here's where we made it our own: our 'Nduja saw the inside of our gravity-fed cold smoker for 10 days before dry curing for 8 weeks. That layer of sweet smoke rounds out the delicious bite of hot, floral, and earthy Calabrian peppers for a slice that's a little more firm than the original 'Nduja but layered with even more intense and complex flavors. The soft center of the salame is spreadable on warm bread for a simple first course, but since our 'Nduja is firm enough to slice paper thin, we'll take it to top a pizza, dress a salad or soup, or stir into sauce for cut pasta or lasagna.All Smoking Goose recipes begin on the farm.

912	BBQ Sauce	We've been making this highly addictive sauce/dip for ourselves and tinkering with the recipe since 1999. Not just for bbqs, this can be used instead of ketchup and as a general sauce/dip for any kind of meat or vegetables. We use it in sandwiches, as a dip for fries and roasted potatoes, on burgers and hot dogs. You can even make meat loaf with it. One dish we love to make is pulled bbq chicken or turkey sandwichs with coleslaw as they do in North Carolina - search online lots of recipes! If you are vegetarian, it is perfect seasoning for a wide variety of dishes. Just be creative! It is delicious all year round.Not too spicy, but not too mild. It is a perfect combination of spices, heat, sweetness and tang. The complex, addictive flavor is due to our use of more than seven types of chilies and peppers, and many, many spices. Just measuring out all the ingredients takes an hour! Read the rave review by Food & Wine magazine about it.Our bbq sauce is gluten free and contains organic California grown GMO-free tomatoes, processed by Neil Jones in Hollister, California.Ingredients: organic tomatoes, brown cane sugar, organic vinegar, mustard, organic wheat-free soy sauce, spices, garlic, salt.	16	fl oz	6.99	Meat	Rubs & Marinades	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/YlD5s4PcT8q5ojK7E2rQ_FK1A6460.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N

For recipe ideas check out our website.About our trout:TwoXSea began testing our fishmeal alternative in 2009 to produce a farmed trout using a nearly pure vegetarian diet of algae, and plant-based products. Originally the feed contained approximately 3% fish oil, which has since been completely eliminated to create a farmed trout that is raised on a 100% vegetarian diet. The results we achieved are stunning and a true culinary delight. The beautifully balanced sweet flavor, superior texture and lighter firm flesh almost perfectly mirror that of a wild trout. The Omega 3 levels are higher than that of wild salmon as well.McFarland Springs is an environmental dream. The water supply comes from the headwaters of a natural spring, extremely cold and free of the pesticides and contaminates found in other water sources. The spring not only provides for the trout, but also generates all of the electricity for the farm though hydroelectric. It is raised locally, lowering carbon footprint and further promoting regional cuisine. The fish is hand harvested and processed, instead of machine processed as is customary.Typically, farmed fish are fed fishmeal which is made up of small fish that are being taken from the ocean at alarming rates. These fish are then ground, dried, and fed to many types of farmed fish in order to increase their growth rates. This practice is an environmental catastrophe and not sustainable. Lastly, the flavor and texture is that of wild trout with a sweet flavor and lighter, firm flesh.

956	Frozen Wild Sablefish Fillet	Sometimes the freshest seafood comes from\nthe freezer. \nAs soon as fish leaves the water it\nbegins losing freshness. Your average fillet is several days old by the time it\nreaches your plate, and the taste and texture have already suffered. We use\nfreezing to stop time and preserve the freshness of our fish. We seal our fish\nin vacuum bags that protect the fillets from freezer burn. We freeze our\nindividually vacuum packaged fillets quickly and at a low temperature, which\npreserves the texture of the fish. Most importantly, we freeze our fish immediately\nafter it’s caught. Our fish doesn’t travel the world, it’s landed twenty miles\nfrom where it’s filleted and frozen. Thaw exactly the amount you need right\nbefore you need it, and our fish will always taste like it was reeled in\nyesterday. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur\nsablefish are caught off the coast of Northern California by small-scale fishing\nboats using traps. We rush to make sure that the fish are filleted and frozen immediately,\nso that our sablefish tastes like it was caught yesterday. These rich, buttery\nfish are commonly called Black cod, though they are not technically a part of the\ncod family. You can hold these fillets in your freezer for up to one year.\nThawing Instructions: It is\nbest to thaw our Frozen Wild Sablefish Fillets slowly under refrigeration. Thawing\nslowly keeps the fillets firm. Nobody likes mushy fish. Thaw just what you\nplan on eating. Remove fillets from bags and place in a bowl inside your\nrefrigerator. Allow the fillets to thaw for 8 to 12 hours.

969	Smoked McFarland Springs Trout Fillet	McFarland Springs Trout is delicious and nutritious. And it's more than unique – it is the world’s first deliberate collaboration to responsibly farm sustainable fish. This product is smoked fillets prepackaged with the skin on. Great for use as lox for bagels and cream cheese, on a salad, or just by itself. About our trout:McFarland Springs is an environmental dream. The water supply comes from the headwaters of a natural spring, extremely cold and free of the pesticides and contaminates found in other water sources. The spring not only provides for the trout, but also generates all of the electricity for the farm though hydroelectric. It is raised locally, lowering carbon footprint and further promoting regional cuisine. The fish is hand harvested and processed, instead of machine processed as is customary.Typically, farmed fish are fed fishmeal which is made up of small fish that are being taken from the ocean at alarming rates. These fish are then ground, dried, and fed to many types of farmed fish in order to increase their growth rates. This practice is an environmental catastrophe and not sustainable. With higher levels of healthy Omega-3s than wild salmon, and zero trace of mercury or contaminants, McFarland Springs trout provides exceptional nutrition benefits. Lastly, the flavor and texture is that of wild trout with a sweet flavor and lighter, firm flesh. The extreme cold created by the natural spring creates slow growth rates, but far better texture.Thanks for your support!-Team TwoXSea 	1.25	lb	44.99	Fish	Smoked	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/vOfMSmTTSuiqBP1VjOYP_FK1A8418.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N
